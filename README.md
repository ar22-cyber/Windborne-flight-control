# Flight Control Operator Application - Alfie Reyes

## Why I'm a Great Fit
I have hands-on experience managing complex, real-time technical systems. At **Tesla**, I operated the **Optimus Bot** using advanced control interfaces, and at **xAI**, I supported the **Grok** app, troubleshooting software conflicts and ensuring a seamless user experience. I am used to working under tight deadlines and handling the "unpredictable" nature of hardware-software integration.

## Relevant Experience
* **Data Collection Operator (Optimus)**: Real-time robotics piloting and debugging.
* **App Support Specialist (Grok)**: Technical troubleshooting and user feedback loops.
* **AI Tutor**: Data curation and RLHF training.

## Professional Values
I am an adaptable problem-solver. Whether it's a operation issue or a robotic malfunction, I stay calm and find the solution to be able to succeed at the task.
